# deepfake-detection
Leveraging LSTM networks, deepfake detection identifies  manipulated content through temporal analysis in video sequences.  Behavioral biometrics recognition with LSTM models detects  inconsistencies in facial expressions, speech, or eye movements for  effective deepfake detection.
